# Composable GitHub Viewer Template

In this repository is a template (built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)) for developing "viewers" for use in [Composable Github]().

## Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

## Develop locally

```bash
yarn dev
```

A development server should now be running on [localhost:4000](localhost:4000).

## Sandbox

When you visit the development server in your browser, you should see two inputs:

1. An `input` that accepts the direct path to a file or a directory on github.com. Below is a list of some valid file/directory paths.

- https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/README.md (file)
- https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/0.3-stable/README.md (file)
- https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-dom/index.js (file)
- https://github.com/facebook/react/ (folder)
- https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/0.3-stable (folder)
- https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages (folder)

2. A `select` that lists out the contents of the `viewers` array that you have defined in your package.json. More on that in the next section.

Once you've entered a valid path, choose from the different viewer types and the content _should_ be rendered beneath. Be sure to check your console for errors if you think something has broken!

## Developing viewers

First, open `package.json` and locate the `viewers` key. You'll notice an array of viewer objects that all have the same shape (note that all of the fields are currently required).

```ts
interface ViewerDefinition {
  type: "file" | "folder";
  title: string;
  description: string;
  entry: string;
  extensions: string[];
}
```

From top to bottom,

- `type` determines whether this viewer applies to, well, files or folders.
- `title` and `description` are both presentational attributes that affect how the viewer will appear on the marketplace
- `entry` is the most important attribute, and its value should be a file path (relative to `/src`) to your viewer's entry point.
- `extensions` is an array of file extensions (without the leading dot) which lets Composable GitHub know for which types of files this viewer should be listed. `*` represents a wildcard value, meaning the viewer will always be listed.

With your viewer definition in place, let's take a look at the source code for a given viewer.

### File Viewers

A file viewer is a React component that receives a special set of
props and returns some JSX. Specifically, the props look like:

```ts
interface FileViewerProps {
  // (todo): provide correct typing here
  metadata: any;
  content: string;
  context: {
    download_url: string;
    file: string;
    path: string;
    repo: string;
    owner: string;
    sha: string;
    username: string;
  };
}
```

For simple use cases, the `content` prop will be the most useful, as it represents the actual content of the file you're looking at on the Composable GitHub UI. But if you need additional context (such as the path to the file, the raw download URL of the file, or the owner/repo in which the file lives), you can access it via the handy `context` prop.

A few caveats and callouts:

- You can use both third-party _and_ relative imports in your viewer code! Simply put, feel free to install any dependencies from NPM, or import a local JS/CSS file and it should be included in the final bundle.
- Your viewer entry file **must export a function a named Viewer**. If it does not, bad things will happen.

### Folder Viewers

A folder viewer is also a React component that receives a special set of props and returns some JSX. Specifically, the props look like:

```ts
interface FolderViewerProps {
  // (todo): provide correct typing here
  metadata: any;
  tree: {
    path: string;
    mode: string;
    type: string;
    sha: string;
    size: number;
    url: string;
  }[];
  context: {
    download_url: string;
    file: string;
    path: string;
    repo: string;
    owner: string;
    sha: string;
    username: string;
  };
}
```

For simple use cases, the `tree` prop will be the most useful, as it represents the underlying file tree of the directory you're looking at on the Composable GitHub UI. But if you need additional context (such as the path to the file, the raw download URL of the file, or the owner/repo in which the file lives), you can access it via the handy `context` prop.

A few caveats and callouts:

- You can use both third-party _and_ relative imports in your viewer code! Simply put, feel free to install any dependencies from NPM, or import a local JS/CSS file and it should be included in the final bundle.
- Your viewer entry file **must export a function a named Viewer**. If it does not, bad things will happen.

## @githubnext/utils

To reduce the cognitive load associated with writing file and folder viewer components, we've assembled a helper library called `@githunext/utils` that exposes interface definitions and a few helper functions. This list will undoubtedly change over time, so be sure to check out [the repository page](https://github.com/githubnext/utils) for more detail.

```tsx
import {
  FileViewerProps,
  FolderViewerProps,
  // A nifty hook that allows you to use Tailwind classes in your viewer component without *any* set up! ðŸŽ‰
  useTailwindCdn,
  // A helper function that returns the "language" of a file, given a valid file path with extension.
  getLanguageFromFilename
} from '@githubnext/utils`
```
